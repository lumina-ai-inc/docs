Chunking is the process of grouping segments into groups (chunks). This varies based on end-application and use-case,
but generally the goal is to put together <a>segments</a> that come together to form a cohesive idea.
The end case is usually indexing for search or organizing training data.

We offer an intelligent chunking algorithm - which can be configured or turned off completely to return individual segments.
This section details how are intelligent chunking works.

## Intelligent Chunking

Segmentation is a core part of our intelligent chunking algorithm. We group segments into chunks based on their `segment_type` heirarchy and have an aproximate max-chunk size (word count)
that can be configured by changing the `chunk_size` parameter.

The chunking algorithm works as follows:

1. Remove headers and footers
2. Add to a chunk until we hit a <b>breaking condition</b>, or if the chunk word count is approximately equal to the `chunk_size`.

### Breaking Conditions

We go down the segment hierarchy (from `Title -> Subheading -> Other`).

## Turning it off

## Turning it off

If you would like to receive individual segments as opposed to chunks, you can set `chunk_size` to `0`. This is recommended if you would like to handle chunking yourself.
