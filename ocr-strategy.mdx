title: OCR Strategy
description: "Picking an OCR strategy"
---

We offer three types of OCR strategies - `Auto`, `All` and `Off`. This section details the differences between each strategy, and when a specific strategy should be used.

```typescript
type OCRStrategy = "Auto" | "All" | "Off";
```

## Auto

The Auto strategy was made to optimize for speed without sacrificing on quality. By default - it will carry out OCR on all <b>Picture</b> and <b>Table</b> `segment_type`.
For other segment types - it will only perform OCR if a text layer doesn't exist.

## All

The All strategy is the most comprehensive - it will perform OCR on all segments. This is useful if you want to

## Off

The Off strategy is the most basic - it will not perform OCR on any segments. This is useful if you want to ignore all content that is not text.
