title: OCR Strategy
description: "Picking an OCR strategy"
---

We offer three types of OCR strategies - `Auto`, `All` and `Off`. This section details the differences between each strategy, and when a specific strategy should be used.

```typescript
type OCRStrategy = "Auto" | "All" | "Off";
```

## Auto

The Auto strategy was made to optimize for speed without sacrificing on quality. By default - it will carry out OCR on all **Picture** and **Table** `segment_type`.
For other segment types - it will only perform OCR if a text layer doesn't exist.

## All

This will perform OCR on all segments.

## Off

No OCR will be performed. This is useful if you only want to use the existing text layer and will **reduce processing time significantly**.
