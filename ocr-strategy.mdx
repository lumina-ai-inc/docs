title: OCR Strategy
description: "Picking an OCR strategy"
---

We offer three types of OCR strategies - `Auto`, `All` and `Off`. This section details the differences between each strategy, and when a specific strategy should be used.

```typescript
type OCRStrategy = "Auto" | "All" | "Off";
```

## Auto

The Auto strategy was made to optimize for speed without sacrificing on quality. By default - it will carry out OCR on all **Picture** and **Table** `segment_type`.
For other segment types - it will only perform OCR if a text layer doesn't exist.

## All

This will perform OCR on all segments - if a text layer already exists, the `content` field will be populated from the OCR layer instead. This will also make sure you get image snips for every segment.

## Off

This is useful if you only want to use the existing text layer to populate the `content` field for segments, it will also reduce processing time significantly. **Table** with a text layer will not be structured, and **Picture** segments will not have any `content` returned.
