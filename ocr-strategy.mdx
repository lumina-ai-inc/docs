OCR is used to extract text from textblocks, structure tables, and extract text from images. It is also linked to returning image-snips of segments from the document.

We offer three types of OCR strategies - `Auto`, `All` and `Off`. This section details the differences between each strategy, and when a specific strategy should be used.

## Auto

The Auto strategy was made to optimize for speed without sacrificing on quality. By default - it will carry out OCR on all <b>Picture</b> and <b>Table</b> `segment_type`.
For other segment types - it will only perform OCR if a text layer doesn't exist
