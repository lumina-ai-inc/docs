title: Polling the TaskResponse
sidebarTitle: Polling
---

The Chunkr AI API follows a task-based pattern where you create a task and monitor its progress through polling. 
The `poll()` method handles this by automatically checking the task's status at regular intervals until it transitions out of the `Starting` or `Processing` states.

After polling completes, it's important to verify the final task status, which will be one of:
- `Succeeded`: Task completed successfully
- `Failed`: Task encountered an error
- `Cancelled`: Task was manually cancelled

## Synchronous Usage

When you have a `TaskResponse` object, you can poll it. 
Look at [creating](/sdk/data-operations/create) and [getting](/sdk/data-operations/get) a task for more information on how to get a `TaskResponse` object.

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

# Initialize client
chunkr = Chunkr()

try:
    # Given that you already have a task object, you can poll it
    task.poll()  
    print(task.output.chunks)
finally:
    # Clean up when done
    chunkr.close()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Asynchronous Usage

For async applications, use `await`:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
import asyncio

async def process_document():
    # Initialize client
    chunkr = Chunkr()

    try:
        # Given that you already have a task object
        await task.poll()  
        print(task.output.chunks)
    finally:
        # Clean up when done
        chunkr.close()
```
</CodeGroup>

## Error Handling

By default, failed tasks i.e. `task.status == "Failed"` will not raise exceptions. You can configure this behavior using the `raise_on_failure` parameter when initializing the client:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

# Initialize client with automatic error raising
chunkr = Chunkr(raise_on_failure=True)
```
