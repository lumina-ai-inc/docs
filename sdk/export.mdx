Chunkr AI allows you to export task results in multiple formats. You can get the content directly and save it to a file.

## Available Export Formats

### HTML Export

This will collate the `html` from every `segment` in all `chunks`, and create a single HTML file.

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Get HTML content as string
html = task.html()

# Or save directly to file
html = task.html(output_file="output/result.html")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Markdown Export

This will collate the `markdown` from every `segment` in all `chunks`, and create a single markdown file.

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Get markdown content as string
md = task.markdown()

# Or save directly to file
md = task.markdown(output_file="output/result.md")
```
</CodeGroup>

### Text Export

This will collate the `content` from every `segment` in all `chunks`, and create a single text file.

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Get plain text content as string
text = task.content()

# Or save directly to file
text = task.content(output_file="output/result.txt")
```
</CodeGroup>    

### JSON Export

This will return the complete task data.

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Get complete task data as dictionary
json = task.json()

# Or save directly to file
json = task.json(output_file="output/result.json")
```
</CodeGroup>

## File Output

When using the `output_file` parameter:
- Directories in the path will be created automatically if they don't exist
- Files are written with UTF-8 encoding
- Existing files will be overwritten

Example with custom path:
    
<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Create nested directory structure and save file
task.html(output_file="exports/2024/january/result.html")
```
</CodeGroup>
