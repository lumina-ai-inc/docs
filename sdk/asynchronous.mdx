title: Using Chunkr AI Asynchronously
sidebarTitle: Asynchronous
---

Chunkr AI's SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous usage patterns. 
The same client class `Chunkr` can be used for both patterns, making it flexible for different application needs.
All methods exists in both synchronous and asynchronous versions.

## Synchronous Usage

For simple scripts or applications that don't require asynchronous operations, you can use the synchronous pattern:

```python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

# Initialize client
chunkr = Chunkr()

try:
    # Upload a file and wait for processing
    task = chunkr.upload("document.pdf")
    print(task.task_id)

    # Create task without waiting - you will get back a task object without chunks
    task = chunkr.create_task("document.pdf")
    result = task.poll()  # Check status when needed - this will return a task object with chunks
finally:
    # Clean up when done
    chunkr.close()
```

## Asynchronous Usage

For applications that benefit from asynchronous operations (like web servers or background tasks), you can use the async pattern:

```python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
import asyncio

async def process_document():
    # Initialize client
    chunkr = Chunkr()

    try:
        # Upload a file and wait for processing
        task = await chunkr.upload("document.pdf")
        print(task.task_id)

        # Create task without waiting - you will get back a task object without chunks
        task = await chunkr.create_task("document.pdf")
        result = await task.poll()  # Check status when needed - this will return a task object with chunks
    finally:
        # Clean up when done
        chunkr.close()
