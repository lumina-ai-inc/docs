Chunkr AI provides methods to delete tasks when they're no longer needed. Any task that has status `Succeeded` or `Failed` can be deleted.
You can delete tasks either by their ID or using a task object.

## Deleting by Task ID

Use the `delete_task()` method when you have the task ID:

```python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Delete task by ID
chunkr.delete_task("task_123")
```

## Deleting from Task Object

If you have a task object, you can delete it directly using the `delete()` method:

```python
# Get existing task
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123")

# Delete the task
task.delete()
```

## Async Usage

For async applications, remember to use `await`:

```python
# Delete by ID
await chunkr.delete_task("task_123")

# Or delete from task object
task = await chunkr.get_task("task_123")
await task.delete()
```
