description: Learn how to retrieve and read task information from Chunkr AI
---

You can retrieve information about a task at any time using the `get_task()` method
This is useful for checking the status of previously created tasks or accessing their results.

## Basic Usage


```python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Get task by ID
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123")

# Access task information
print(task.status)
print(task.output)
```

## Customizing the Response

The `get_task()` method accepts two optional parameters to customize the response:

```python
# Exclude chunks from output
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123", include_chunks=False) 

# Get task with base64-encoded URLs instead of presigned URLs
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123", base64_urls=True)
```

## Response Options

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `include_chunks` | `True` | When `True`, includes all processed chunks in the response. Set to `False` to receive a lighter response without chunk data. |
| `base64_urls` | `False` | When `True`, returns URLs as base64-encoded strings. When `False`, returns presigned URLs for direct access. |

## Async Usage

For async applications, remember to use `await`:

```python
# Get task asynchronously
task = await chunkr.get_task("task_123")
```

## Best Practices

- Store task IDs when creating tasks if you need to retrieve them later
- Use `include_chunks=False` when you only need task metadata
- Consider using base64 URLs (`base64_urls=True`) when you need to cache or store the URLs locally
