---

Chunkr AI allows you to cancel tasks that are in queede but haven't started processing. Any task that has status `Starting` can be canceled.
You can cancel tasks either by their ID or using a task object.

## Canceling by Task ID

Use the `cancel_task()` method when you have the task ID:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Cancel task by ID
chunkr.cancel_task("task_123")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Canceling from Task Object

If you have a task object, you can cancel it directly using the `cancel()` method. This method will also return the updated task status:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Get existing task
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123")

# Cancel the task and get updated status
updated_task = task.cancel()
print(updated_task.status) # Will show canceled status
```

</CodeGroup>

## Async Usage

For async applications, use `await`:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Cancel by ID
await chunkr.cancel_task("task_123")

# Or cancel from task object
task = await chunkr.get_task("task_123")
updated_task = await task.cancel()
```
