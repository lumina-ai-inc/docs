description: Learn how to upload files and create processing tasks with Chunkr AI
---

The Chunkr AI SDK provides two main methods for uploading files:
- `upload()`: Upload and wait for complete processing
- `create_task()`: Upload and get an immediate task response

## Complete Processing with `upload()`

The `upload()` method handles the entire process - it uploads your file and waits for processing to complete:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Upload and wait for complete processing
task = chunkr.upload("path/to/your/file")

# All processing is done - you can access results immediately
print(task.task_id)
print(task.status) # Will be "completed"
print(task.output) # Contains processed results
```

</CodeGroup>

## Instant Response with `create_task()`

If you want to start processing but don't want to wait for completion, use `create_task()`:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Create task without waiting
task = chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/file")

# Task is created but processing may not be complete
print(task.task_id)
print(task.status)  # Might be "Starting"
print(task.output)  # Might be None if processing isn't finished
```

</CodeGroup>

## Checking Task Status with `poll()`

When using `create_task()`, you can check the status later using `poll()`:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Create task immediately
task = chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/file")

# ... do other work ...

# Check status when needed
result = task.poll()
print(result.status)
print(result.output)  # Now contains processed results if status is "Succeeded"
```

</CodeGroup>

For async applications, remember to use `await`:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# Create task immediately
task = await chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/file")

# ... do other work ...

# Check status when needed
result = await task.poll()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Supported File Types

We support PDFs, Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), and images. You can upload them in several ways:

<CodeGroup> 

```python Python
# From a file path
task = chunkr.upload("path/to/your/file")

# From an opened file
with open("path/to/your/file", "rb") as f:
    task = chunkr.upload(f)

# From a URL
task = chunkr.upload("https://example.com/document.pdf")

# From a base64 string
task = chunkr.upload("JVBERi0...")

# From a PIL Image
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("path/to/your/photo.jpg")
task = chunkr.upload(img)
```
</CodeGroup>
