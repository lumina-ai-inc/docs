This section details the differences between each strategy, and when a specific strategy should be used.\n\n```typescript\ntype OCRStrategy = \"Auto\" | \"All\" | \"Off\";\n```\n\n## Auto\n\nThe Auto strategy was made to optimize for speed without sacrificing on quality. By default - it will carry out OCR on all **Picture** and **Table** `segment_type`.\nFor other segment types - it will only perform OCR if a text layer doesn't exist.\n\n## All\n\nThis will perform OCR on all segments.\n\n## Off\n\nThis is useful if you only want to use the existing text layer to populate the `content` field for segments, it will also reduce processing time significantly.\n"
