This section details the differences between each model, and when a specific model should be used.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can select which model to use by setting the `model` parameter in the `POST` request body.\n\n```typescript\ntype Model = \"HighQuality\" | \"Fast\";\n```\n\n## Fast\n\nThe Fast model uses [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and runs on CPUs - which makes it much faster than the HighQuality model. It depends on a pre-existing text-layer to create bounding boxes.\n\nThis makes it great for text, table and formula segmentation - but it struggles when dealing with images.\nIt can still segment images that are surrounded/bounded by text to some degree. A good example is graphs that have Y/X axes with labels.\n\n## HighQuality\n\nThe HighQuality model uses [VGT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14978) - a state-of-the-art two-stream Vision Grid Transformer.\nThis model 'has eyes' and can understand layouts with intelligence, so a pre-existing text-layer is not required.\nIt's better at classifying content into [`segment_type`](/segment#segment-types).\n\n## What will work best for me?\n\nIn most cases, we recommend using the Fast model for it's speed and cost benefits,\nand using the HighQuality model as a fallback for when the `content` field in the `output` object is empty (i.e when the Fast model returns an empty string).\n\nIf you require great table, image or handwriting segmentation consistently, then you should use the HighQuality model.\n"
