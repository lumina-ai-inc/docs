Any task that has status `Succeeded` or `Failed` can be deleted.\nYou can delete tasks either by their ID or using a task object.\n\n## Deleting by Task ID\n\nUse the `delete_task()` method when you have the task ID:\n\n<CodeGroup> \n\n```python Python\nfrom chunkr_ai import Chunkr\nchunkr = Chunkr()\n\n# Delete task by ID\nchunkr.delete_task(\"task_123\")\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Deleting from TaskResponse Object\n\nIf you have a task object, you can delete it directly using the `delete()` method:\n\n<CodeGroup> \n\n```python Python\n# Get existing task\ntask = chunkr.get_task(\"task_123\")\n\n# Delete the task\ntask.delete()\n```\n\n</CodeGroup>\n\n## Async Usage\n\nFor async applications, remember to use `await`:\n\n<CodeGroup> \n\n```python Python\n# Delete by ID\nawait chunkr.delete_task(\"task_123\")\n\n# Or delete from task object\ntask = await chunkr.get_task(\"task_123\")\nawait task.delete()\n```\n</CodeGroup>"
