title: Chunks
---

The output of a task is a list of chunks. Each chunk is a collection of one or more segments.

The grouping of segments into chunks depends on the `target_chunk_length` parameter. Click [here](/chunking) to learn more about how to configure it.

## Chunk Model

The `Chunk` model represents a collection of segments. It consists of:

```typescript
interface Chunk {
    segments: Segment[];
    chunk_length: number;
}
```

## Segments

This will contain an array of segments that make up the chunk.

## Chunk Length

This will contain the actual length of the chunk, i.e. number of words in the chunk.
This may be different from the `target_chunk_length` as the segments are not split into smaller segments.
