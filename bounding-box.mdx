The bounding box is a rectangle that bounds an item on the document. It is used for both segments and ocr results.

## Bounding Box Model

The `BoundingBox` model represents the bounding box of a segment and can be used to for highlights and annotations, as well as for VLM input as images.

```typescript
interface BoundingBox {
  top_left: [number, number];
  top_right: [number, number];
  bottom_right: [number, number];
  bottom_left: [number, number];
}
```

## Coordinate System

Each key in the `BoundingBox` model represents a corner of the bounding box, defined by its [x, y] coordinates within the image. The coordinate system follows the standard image convention:

- The origin (0, 0) is located at the top-left corner of the image.
- The x-coordinate increases from left to right.
- The y-coordinate increases from top to bottom.

This system allows for precise positioning of the bounding box within the document or image.
