We use AI to identify and extract individual elements from the document, which we call segments.

## Segment Model

The `Segment` model represents individual elements extracted from the document. It includes the following properties:

```typescript
interface Segment {
    segment_id: string;
    bbox: BoundingBox;
    page_number: number;
    page_width: number;
    page_height: number;
    content: string;
    segment_type: SegmentType; 
    ocr?: OCRResult[];
    image?: string;
    html?: string;
    markdown?: string;
}
```
