We use AI to identify and extract individual elements from the document, which we call segments.
Each segment has a `bbox` which is the bounding box of the segment and a `segment_type` which is the type of the segment.

## Segment Model

The `Segment` model represents individual elements extracted from the document. It includes the following properties:

```typescript
interface Segment {
    bbox: BoundingBox;
    content: string;
    html?: string;
    image?: string;
    markdown?: string;
    ocr?: OCRResult[];
    page_height: number;
    page_number: number;
    page_width: number;
    segment_id: string;
    segment_type: SegmentType; 
}
```

## Bbox (Bounding box)

The `BoundingBox` model represents the bounding box of a segment and can be used to for highlights and annotations, as well as for VLM input as images.
Click [here](/bounding-box) to learn more about the bounding box model.

## Content

The `Content` model represents the content of a segment, we use the following rules to extract the content:

- If `ocr` exists then use the text from the `ocr` if the average confidence is greater than the threshold
- If the average confidence from `ocr` is less than the threshold then use the text layer of the document
- If there is no `ocr` then use the text layer of the document

## OCR

The `ocr` field is the OCR result of a segment. Click [here](/ocr) to learn more about the OCR model.

## Image

The `image` is a presigned URL to the image of the segment. They are only generated for segments that are processed by ocr. 

To learn more about how to configure the ocr please refer to the [ocr](/ocr) section.

## HTML

The `html` field is the html representation of a segment. It contains the `content` of the segment with the appropriate HTML tags applied for the `segment_type`.
For tables the html will contain the table in html format and will be different from the raw `content` field, but will contain the same text.

## Markdown

The `markdown` field is the markdown representation of a segment. It contains the `content` of the segment with the appropriate markdown tags applied for the `segment_type`.
For tables the markdown will contain the table in markdown format and will be different from the raw `content` field, but will contain the same text.

## OCR

The `ocr` field is the OCR result of a segment. Click [here](/ocr) to learn more about the OCR model.

## Page height

The `page_height` is the height of the page in pixels.

## Page width

The `page_width` is the width of the page in pixels.

## Page number

The `page_number` is the number of the page in the document where the segment is located.

## Segment Types

The `segment_type` is classified by the `Model` used during the segmentation process. To learn more about how to configure the model please refer to the [model](/model) section.

This is the list of all the segment types in the order of the hierarchy:
```typescript
type SegmentType =
  | "Title"
  | "Section header"
  | "Text"
  | "List item"
  | "Table"
  | "Picture"
  | "Caption"
  | "Formula"
  | "Footnote"
  | "Page header"
  | "Page footer"
```
