Chunkr is designed for high-throughput processing. In general there are no file size or page count limits, but there are a few considerations that are discussed here.

## Task Timeout

All tasks are subject to a **10-minute** timeout. If a task does not complete within this time, it will automatically fail.

If you have a file that consistently times out, please [contact our support team](mailto:support@chunkr.ai) to discuss potential solutions.

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and system stability, we enforce a rate limit of **10 files per second**. If you exceed this limit, our API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

Our Python SDK is designed to handle this gracefully. It automatically detects `429` errors and retries the request after a short backoff period. This means you can upload files in a loop without implementing your own rate-limiting logic.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

chunkr = Chunkr()

# The SDK will automatically handle rate limiting for you.

# No extra code is needed.

for i in range(20):
chunkr.create*task(f"path/to/file*{i}.pdf")

````
</CodeGroup>

## File Size Limits

In general, there are no hard limits on the size of the files you can upload. Our architecture is built to handle large files by processing them in parallel. However, there is one exception:

*   **Base64 Uploads**: When uploading a file as a base64-encoded string, the total request size is limited to **1GB**. This is a practical limit to ensure reliable transfer over HTTP.

If you need to upload files larger than 1GB, we recommend using a file path or URL instead of base64 encoding.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

chunkr = Chunkr()

# Recommended for large files
task = chunkr.upload("path/to/very/large/file.pdf")

# This will fail if the request size exceeds 1GB
# task = chunkr.upload(large_base64_string, file_name="large_file.pdf")
````

</CodeGroup>

## Page Limits

There are **no page limits** for documents. Our parallel processing architecture allows us to handle documents with any number of pages, from a single page to thousands.
