description: "Understanding Chunkr's asynchronous task-based processing system"
---

All file processing in Chunkr is handled through a task-based system. When you submit a file, a new task is created, and you receive a `task_id`. Use this ID to check the task's status until it's complete, or use the `wait_for_completion` parameter to automatically wait for results.

This asynchronous approach allows you to submit long-running jobs without tying up your application. Once the task status is `Succeeded`, the full processing results are available.

## Key capabilities

- **Broad File Support**: Process a variety of file types like PDFs, Excel, PPTs, Doc.
- **Multiple Input Sources**: Provide files directly, from a URL, or as a base64-encoded string.
- **Full Task Control**: Manage jobs and customize results with processing parameters.
- **Data Retention**: Set custom expiration times for automatic data deletion.
- **Async Support**: Use synchronous or asynchronous clients based on your application needs.
- **Webhook Support**: Receive real-time notifications when tasks complete, eliminating the need for polling.

### Example: Create and Poll

Here's how you can process a file and poll for its results using our SDKs.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

# Initialize the client
client = Chunkr(
    api_key="your_api_key",  # Optional if CHUNKR_API_KEY env var is set
)

# 1. Create a task from a URL
task = client.tasks.parse.create(
    file="https://example.com/document.pdf"
)
print(f"Task created with ID: {task.task_id}")

# 2. Get the task result (with automatic polling)
task = client.tasks.get(
    task_id=task.task_id, 
    wait_for_completion=True
)

# 3. Access the results
if task.status == "Succeeded":
    print("Task completed successfully!")
    print(f"Document has {len(task.output.chunks)} chunks")
else:
    print(f"Task status: {task.status}")
```

```typescript TypeScript
import ChunkrAI from 'chunkr-ai';

// Initialize the client
const client = new ChunkrAI({
    apiKey: 'your_api_key'  // Optional if CHUNKR_API_KEY env var is set
});

// 1. Create a task from a URL
const task = await client.tasks.parse.create({
    file: 'https://example.com/document.pdf'
});
console.log(`Task created with ID: ${task.taskId}`);

// 2. Get the task result (with automatic polling)
const result = await client.tasks.get(task.taskId, {
    waitForCompletion: true
});

// 3. Access the results
if (result.status === 'Succeeded') {
    console.log('Task completed successfully!');
    console.log(`Document has ${result.output.chunks.length} chunks`);
} else {
    console.log(`Task status: ${result.status}`);
}
```

```bash cURL
# 1. Create a task from a URL
curl -X POST https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/tasks/parse \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file": "https://example.com/document.pdf"
  }'

# Response will include task_id
# {"task_id": "task_123", "status": "Starting", ...}

# 2. Poll for task completion
curl -X GET "https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/tasks/task_123" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# 3. Keep polling until status is "Succeeded"
# Response will include the processed chunks when complete
```
