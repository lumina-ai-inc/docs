Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, 
such as scanned paper documents, PDF files, or images, into editable and searchable data. 

## OCR Strategy

Chunkr AI API always returns OCR results. You can configure the OCR strategy using the `ocr_strategy` parameter.

We have two strategies:
- `All`: Processes all pages with our OCR model.
- `Auto` (Default): Intelligently applies OCR only to pages with missing or low-quality text. When a text layer is present, the bounding boxes from that layer are used instead of running OCR.

<CodeGroup> 
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
from chunkr_ai.models import Configuration, OcrStrategy

chunkr = Chunkr()

chunkr.upload("path/to/file", Configuration(
    ocr_strategy=OcrStrategy.ALL # can also be OcrStrategy.AUTO
))
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@path/to/file \
  -F 'ocr_strategy="\"All\"";type=application/json'
```
</CodeGroup>

The `Auto` strategy provides the best balance between accuracy and performance for most use cases. 
Use the `All` strategy when you need to ensure consistent text extraction across all pages or when you suspect the existing text layer might be unreliable.

## OCR + Layout Analysis

OCR and Layout Analysis together are a powerful combination. 
It allows us to get word level bounding boxes and text while also understanding the layout of the document. 

You can use that to make experiences like:
- Highlighting exact numbers in a table
- Highlighting text in images
- Embedding the text from pictures for semantic search

## Other common use cases
- Digitizing old books and documents
- Processing invoices and receipts
- Automating form data entry
- Reading license plates
- Converting handwritten notes to digital text
- Extracting text from screenshots and images
