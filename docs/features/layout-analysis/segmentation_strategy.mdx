title: Segmentation Strategy
description: "Controls the segmentation strategy"
---
The chunkr AI API allows you to specify a `segmentation_strategy` for each document. This strategy controls how the document is segmented.

We have two strategies:
- `LayoutAnalysis`: Run our state-of-the-art layout analysis model to identify the layout elements. This is the default strategy.
- `Page`: Each segment is a page.

This is how you can configure the segmentation strategy:

<CodeGroup> 
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
from chunkr_ai.models import Configuration, SegmentationStrategy

chunkr = Chunkr()

chunkr.upload("path/to/file", Configuration(
    segmentation_strategy=SegmentationStrategy.LAYOUT_ANALYSIS 
))
```

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task \
  -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F file=@path/to/file \
  -F 'segmentation_strategy="\"LayoutAnalysis\"";type=application/json'
```
</CodeGroup>

## When to use each strategy

For most documents, we recommend using the `LayoutAnalysis` strategy. This will give you the best results.

Use `Page` for:
- Faster processing speed when you need quick results and layout isn't critical
- Documents with unusual layouts that confuse the layout analysis model
- If the layout is complex but not very information dense, `Page` + VLM can generate surprisingly good HTML and markdown (see [Segment Processing](/docs/features/segment-processing)).
