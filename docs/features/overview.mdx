Different applications have different needs. Chunkr AI API is designed to be flexible and customizable to meet your specific requirements.

We support the following configuration options:
- `chunk_processing`: Controls the setting for the chunking and post-processing of each chunk.
- `expires_in`: The number of seconds until task is deleted.
- `high_resolution`: Whether to use high-resolution images for cropping and post-processing.
- `ocr_strategy`: Controls the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) strategy.
- `pipeline`: Options for layout analysis and OCR providers.
- `segment_processing`: Controls the post-processing of each segment type. Allows you to generate HTML, markdown and run custom VLM prompts.
- `segmentation_strategy`: Controls the segmentation strategy

The configuration options can be combined to create a customized processing pipeline. When a `Task` is created, the configuration is done through the `Configuration` object.

Here is an example of how to configure the API to run a custom VLM prompt on each picture in a document:

<CodeGroup> 
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
from chunkr_ai.models import (
    Configuration, 
    GenerationConfig, 
    GenerationStrategy, 
    SegmentProcessing, 
    SegmentationStrategy
)

chunkr = Chunkr()

chunkr.upload("path/to/file", Configuration(
    segment_processing=SegmentProcessing(
        picture=GenerationConfig(
            llm="Does this picture have a cat in it? Answer must be true or false."
        )
    ),
))
```

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/parse \
  --header 'Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "file": "base64_or_url_to_file",
    "file_name": "document.pdf",
    "segment_processing": {
      "picture": {
        "llm": "Does this picture have a cat in it? Answer must be true or false."
      }
    }
  }'
```
