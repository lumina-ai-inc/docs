## What are webhooks?
Webhooks are how services notify each other of events.

At their core, webhooks are just POST requests to predetermined endpoints.
Endpoints can be whatever you want, and you can add them from the UI.
You normally use one endpoint per service, and that endpoint listens to all event types.

For example, if you receive webhooks from Acme Inc., you can structure your URL like: `https://www.example.com/acme/webhooks/`.

Indicate that a webhook has been processed by returning a 2xx (status code 200-299) response to the webhook message within a reasonable time frame (15 seconds).

It's also important to disable CSRF protection for this endpoint if your framework enables it by default.

Another important aspect of handling webhooks is verifying the signature and timestamp when processing them.

You can learn more about this in the signature verification section.

## Events & payloads
Chunkr currently emits two events:

- `task.updated`: Webhook event payload for any task updates
- `task.parse.updated`: Webhook event payload for parse task updates

Example payload shape:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Task Updated
{
  "event_type": "task.updated",
  "message": null,
  "status": "Starting",
  "task_id": "..."
}
```

```javascript Task Parse Updated
{
  "event_type": "task.parse.updated",
  "message": null,
  "status": "Starting",
  "task_id": "..."
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Add an endpoint
To start listening to messages, you need to configure your endpoints.

Adding an endpoint is as simple as providing a URL that you control and selecting the event types that you want to listen to.

If you don't specify any event types, by default, your endpoint will receive all events, regardless of type.

This can be helpful for getting started and for testing, but we recommend changing this to a subset later on to avoid receiving extraneous messages.

If your endpoint isn't quite ready to start receiving events, you can click the "Svix Play" button to have a unique URL generated for you.

You'll be able to view and inspect webhooks sent to your Svix Play URL, making it effortless to get started.

## Test an endpoint

Once you've added an endpoint, you'll want to make sure it's working.

The "Testing" tab lets you send test events to your endpoint.

After sending an example event, you can click into the message to view the message payload, all of the message attempts, and whether it succeeded or failed.

## Verifying webhooks
It’s important to know whether a webhook has come from `chunkr.ai`, or a third party that might be trying to exploit a vulnerability. 
To avoid this, we send a signature in the header of our webhooks, which you can verify using a signing secret.

The webhooks we send will have three headers that you’ll want to look at:

```javascript Headers
{ 
  "webhook-id": "123", 
  "webhook-timestamp": 1755204338,
  "webhook-signature": "v1,g0h..." 
}
```

To verify the signatures, see Svix's guide on how to verify webhooks with the [Svix libraries](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how) or how to verify [webhooks manually](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).

## Retries

We attempt to deliver each webhook message based on a retry schedule with exponential backoff.

### The schedule

Each message is attempted on the following schedule. Each period starts after the preceding attempt fails:

-   Immediately
-   5 seconds
-   5 minutes
-   30 minutes
-   2 hours
-   5 hours
-   10 hours
-   10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled, delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.

For example, an attempt that fails three times before eventually succeeding will be delivered roughly 35 minutes and 5 seconds following the first attempt.

### Manual retries

You can also use the application portal to manually retry each message at any time, or automatically retry ("Recover") all failed messages starting from a given date.
