The ocr object is the result from the ocr model, we use [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) for this.
It contains a list of `OCRResult` objects.

## OCR Result

```typescript
interface OCRResult {
  bbox: BoundingBox;
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
}
```

Each segment is made form multiple `OCRResult` objects, and they can be used to identify and annotate the text in the segment.
This is useful for tasks such as text extraction, search and more specific highlighting.
For `segment_type` table, each cell is an `OCRResult`.
