title: Chunks
---

The output of a task is encapsulated in an `OutputResponse`, which contains a list of chunks. Each chunk is a collection of one or more segments.

The grouping of segments into chunks depends on the `target_chunk_length` parameter. Click [here](/chunking) to learn more about how to configure it.

## Output Response

The `OutputResponse` struct is the main output of a task. It is defined as:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, ToSchema)]
pub struct OutputResponse {
    pub chunks: Vec<Chunk>,
    pub extracted_json: Option<ExtractedJson>,
}
```

- **chunks**: This is a vector of `Chunk` objects, representing the output of a task.
- **extracted_json**: This is an optional field that may contain additional extracted JSON data.

## Chunk Model

The `Chunk` model represents a collection of segments. It consists of:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone, ToSchema)]
pub struct Chunk {
    pub segments: Vec<Segment>,
    pub chunk_length: i32,
}
```

- **segments**: This is a vector of `Segment` objects that make up the chunk.
- **chunk_length**: This is an integer representing the actual length of the chunk, i.e., the number of words in the chunk. This may differ from the `target_chunk_length` as segments are not split into smaller segments.

## Segments

This will contain an array of segments that make up the chunk.

## Chunk Length

This will contain the actual length of the chunk, i.e., the number of words in the chunk. This may be different from the `target_chunk_length` as the segments are not split into smaller segments.
