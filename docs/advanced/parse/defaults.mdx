title: Default Configuration
---

Chunkr is designed to be highly configurable, but it also comes with sensible defaults to get you started quickly. This page outlines the default settings for various processing options.

Understanding these defaults can help you decide when you need to provide a custom configuration.

## Summary of Defaults

For quick reference, hereâ€™s a summary of the most important default settings.

| Feature                 | Default Value                                     | Notes                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Segmentation Strategy   | `LayoutAnalysis`                                  | Identifies layout elements like tables, text, and images.  |
| OCR Strategy            | `All`                                             | Processes all pages with OCR for maximum text extraction.  |
| Error Handling          | `Fail`                                            | The task will fail immediately if any error occurs.        |
| Pipeline Provider       | `Chunkr`                                          | Uses Chunkr's native models for processing.                |
| Chunk Target Length     | `4096` tokens                                     | Optimal size for many RAG applications.                    |
| Chunk Tokenizer         | `Cl100kBase`                                      | Aligned with OpenAI models like GPT-4.                     |
| LLM Model               | System Default (`chunkr-parse-1-thinking`)        | Our recommended model for general-purpose parsing.         |
| LLM Temperature         | `0.0`                                             | Ensures deterministic, consistent output.                  |
| Task Expiration         | Never                                             | Tasks are stored indefinitely unless `expires_in` is set.  |

## Core Processing Defaults

These settings control the fundamental steps of document analysis and processing.

### Segmentation Strategy

The `segmentation_strategy` determines how a document is initially broken down into logical pieces.

*   **Default**: `LayoutAnalysis`

By default, Chunkr uses its state-of-the-art layout analysis model to identify distinct regions like tables, paragraphs, headers, and images. This provides a rich, structured understanding of the document. The alternative is `Page`, which treats each page as a single segment.

### OCR Strategy

The `ocr_strategy` controls how Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is applied to extract text.

*   **Default**: `All`

The `All` strategy processes every page with our OCR model to ensure all text, including text within images, is extracted. The alternative is `Auto`, which intelligently applies OCR only when a high-quality text layer is not already present.

### Error Handling

The `error_handling` strategy defines the system's behavior when it encounters a processing error.

*   **Default**: `Fail`

By default, any error encountered during processing will cause the task to stop and be marked as `Failed`. This is the safest option for critical workflows. You can change this to `Continue` to allow the task to complete with partial results if non-critical errors occur.

### Pipeline Provider

The `pipeline` setting allows you to choose between different underlying processing engines.

*   **Default**: `Chunkr`

Chunkr's native processing pipeline is used by default. We also support `Azure` Document Intelligence as an alternative provider for layout analysis and OCR.

## Chunking Defaults

Chunking settings control how segments are grouped into larger pieces for RAG and LLM applications.

*   **`target_length`**: `4096` tokens
*   **`tokenizer`**: `Cl100kBase`

By default, chunks are created with a target size of 4096 tokens, using the `Cl100kBase` tokenizer, which is compatible with modern OpenAI models. This ensures chunks are well-sized for providing context to LLMs without exceeding token limits.

---

## LLM Processing Defaults

These settings control how Vision Language Models (VLMs) are used for content generation and analysis.

*   **`llm_model_id`**: System Default
*   **`fallback_strategy`**: System Default Fallback
*   **`temperature`**: `0.0`

Chunkr uses a system-default model for VLM-based tasks (like generating content for tables or pictures). If the primary model fails, it automatically switches to a default fallback model. The temperature is set to `0.0` for deterministic and repeatable results.

---

## Segment Processing Defaults

`segment_processing` offers fine-grained control over how each type of segment is handled after layout analysis. If you don't specify a configuration for a segment type, these defaults are applied.

### At-a-Glance Summary

| Segment Type        | Format      | Strategy | Crop Image | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| `Table`             | `Html`      | `LLM`    | `Auto`     | `true`      |
| `Picture`           | `Markdown`  | `LLM`    | `All`      | `false`     |
| `Page`              | `Markdown`  | `LLM`    | `Auto`     | `false`     |
| `Formula`           | `Markdown`  | `LLM`    | `Auto`     | `false`     |
| `PageHeader`        | `Markdown`  | `Ignore` | `Auto`     | `false`     |
| `PageFooter`        | `Markdown`  | `Ignore` | `Auto`     | `false`     |
| All Other Segments  | `Markdown`  | `Auto`   | `Auto`     | `false`     |

### Detailed Breakdowns

#### `Table`
Tables are processed with an LLM to generate a structured HTML representation. A description is also generated by default.

```python
# Default for Table segments
{
    "format": "Html",
    "strategy": "LLM",
    "crop_image": "Auto",
    "description": True,
    "extended_context": False
}
```

#### `Picture`
Pictures (including charts and graphs) are processed by an LLM to generate a Markdown description, and the image is always cropped.

```python
# Default for Picture segments
{
    "format": "Markdown",
    "strategy": "LLM",
    "crop_image": "All",
    "description": False,
    "extended_context": False
}
```

#### `Page` and `Formula`
When using the `Page` segmentation strategy or when a `Formula` is detected, an LLM is used to generate Markdown content. Formulas are converted to LaTeX.

```python
# Default for Page and Formula segments
{
    "format": "Markdown",
    "strategy": "LLM",
    "crop_image": "Auto",
    "description": False,
    "extended_context": False
}
```

#### `PageHeader` and `PageFooter`
Page headers and footers are ignored by default to avoid including repetitive, low-value content in the output.

```python
# Default for PageHeader and PageFooter
{
    "format": "Markdown",
    "strategy": "Ignore",
    "crop_image": "Auto",
    "description": False,
    "extended_context": False
}
```

#### Other Text-Based Segments
All other standard text-based segments (`Title`, `SectionHeader`, `Text`, `ListItem`, `Caption`, `Footnote`) are processed using fast, heuristic-based methods (`AUTO`) and returned as Markdown.

```python
# Default for other text segments
{
    "format": "Markdown",
    "strategy": "Auto",
    "crop_image": "Auto",
    "description": False,
    "extended_context": False
}
```
