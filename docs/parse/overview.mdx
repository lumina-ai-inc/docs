The Parse feature transforms complex documents into structured data that LLMs can read.

<Frame>Parsing image</Frame>

It intelligently identifies document elements, processes them based on their type, and outputs clean, structured content ready for AI applications and downstream workflow automation.

## Key Features

- **Perfect Markdown & HTML**: LLM-ready content (Markdown, HTML, tables, etc).
- **Reading order intact**: Maintains the natural reading flow for complex layouts.
- **Granular bounding boxes**: Pinpoints element coordinates with precision for easy citations.
- **Native Spreadsheet handling**: 100% reconstruction with formulas, styling, and cell values preserved; precise ranges; cleans tables and converts charts to structured data.
- **Post-processing**: Token-aware chunking, cropped images, and more.

## Example: Parse and access chunk content

Hereâ€™s how you can parse a document and access its chunks using our Python SDK.

<CodeGroup>
```python title="Python"
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr

# Initialize the client with your API key

chunkr = Chunkr()

# Parse a document by creating a task

task = chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/document.pdf")
print(f"Task created with ID: {task.task_id}")

# Poll the task to wait for completion

task.poll()

# Access the chunks from the output

if task.status == "Succeeded":
print(f"Document has {len(task.output.chunks)} chunks.") # `chunk.content` holds the 1:1 structured representation of document elements
for chunk in task.output.chunks:
print(chunk.content)
else:
print(f"Task failed with status: {task.status}")

chunkr.close()

````

```bash title="cURL"
# 1. Create a task to start parsing
# Copy the `task_id` from the response
curl -X POST https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/parse \
  --header "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "file": "base64_or_url_to_file",
    "file_name": "document.pdf"
  }'

# 2. Poll the Get Task endpoint until status is "Succeeded"
# Once complete, the response will contain the output with chunks
curl -X GET https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/{your_task_id} \
  --header "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
````

<Accordion title="Advanced Configuration">

While our defaults work exceptionally well for almost all use cases, Parse offers extensive customization options for specialized needs:

- **[Pipeline (`pipeline`)](/docs/features/pipeline)**: Choose the provider (`Azure` or `Chunkr`) for layout analysis and OCR models.
- **Layout Analysis & OCR**:
  - _Segmentation Strategy (`segmentation_strategy`)_: Choose between `LayoutAnalysis` (default) or a full-page VLM approach for parsing.
  - _OCR Strategy (`ocr_strategy`)_: Use `Auto` to selectively apply OCR or `All` to force it on every page.
- **[Segment-level Customization (`segment_processing`)](/docs/features/segment-processing)**: Control processing for each document element (e.g., `Text`, `Table`, `Picture`):
  - _Processing Strategy (`strategy`)_: For each segment, set the strategy to generate HTML/Markdown. `Auto` (simple OCR + logic), `LLM` (VLM generation), or `Ignore` (remove from output).
  - _Format Control (`format`)_: Control the output format (`Markdown` or `HTML`) for segment content.
  - _Extended Context (`extended_context`)_: Provide the full page image as additional context for VLM processing of a segment. Useful for cases like distant legends for tables and pictures.
  - _Cropped Images (`crop_image`)_: Control if a cropped image of the segment is included.
- **[Chunking (`chunk_processing`)](/docs/features/chunking)**: Configure chunking strategy, sizes, and token-counting model.
- **[LLM Processing (`llm_processing`)](/docs/features/llm-processing)**: Select the VLM provider and model for all VLM tasks.
- **[Error Handling (`error_handling`)](/docs/features/error-handling)**: Set to `Fail` (default) to stop on any error, or `Continue` to process despite non-critical errors.

<Note>
  Our default configuration is optimized through extensive testing and provides
  excellent results for most documents. Only customize if you have specific
  requirements.
