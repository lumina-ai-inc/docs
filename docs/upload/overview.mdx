description: "Using Chunkr's upload options and task based polling system"
---

The Chunkr API and SDKs offer flexible methods to upload files for processing. 

## Key capabilities

*   **Broad File Support**: Process a variety of file types like PDFs, Excel, PPTs, Doc.
*   **Multiple Input Sources**: Provide files directly, from a URL, or as a base64-encoded string.
*   **Configurable Outputs**: Configure the format of your results, like cropped image formats. 
*   **Data Retention**: Set custom expiration times for automatic data deletion.


## The Task System

All file processing in Chunkr is handled through a task-based system. When you submit a file, a new task is created, and you receive a `task_id`. You then use this ID to "poll" (or repeatedly check) the task's status until it's complete.

This asynchronous approach allows you to submit long-running jobs without tying up your application. Once the task status is `Succeeded`, the full processing results are available.

    Chunkr-->>You: Returns "task_id"
    loop Poll for result
        You->>Chunkr: 2. Get Task Status (using "task_id")
        Chunkr-->>You: Status: "Processing"
    end
    You->>Chunkr: 3. Get Task Status (using "task_id")
    Chunkr-->>You: Status: "Succeeded" + Results
  ```

### Example: Upload and Poll

Hereâ€™s how you can upload a file and poll for its results using our Python SDK.

```python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
import time

# Initialize the client
chunkr = Chunkr()

# 1. Create a task without waiting for completion
task = chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/document.pdf")
print(f"Task created with ID: {task.task_id}")

# 2. Poll for the result
# The poll method will automatically wait until the task is complete
task.poll() 

# 3. Access the results
if task.status == "Succeeded":
    print("Task completed successfully!")
    # Now you can work with the output
    print(f"Document has {len(task.output.chunks)} chunks.")
else:
    print(f"Task failed with status: {task.status}")

chunkr.close()
```
