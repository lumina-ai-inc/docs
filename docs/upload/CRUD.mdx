## Creating Tasks

You can create a task by uploading a file from multiple sources. The SDK provides two primary methods for task creation:

*   `upload()`: Uploads a file and waits for the entire processing job to complete.
*   `create_task()`: Submits the file for processing and returns a task ID immediately, allowing for asynchronous polling.

### Complete Processing with `upload()`

Use `upload()` for simplicity when you want to wait for the results.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Upload and wait for complete processing
task = chunkr.upload("path/to/your/file.pdf")

# All processing is done - you can access results immediately
print(task.status) # Will be "Succeeded"
print(task.output) # Contains processed results
```
</CodeGroup>

### Instant Response with `create_task()`

Use `create_task()` in asynchronous applications where you don't want to block execution.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create task without waiting
task = chunkr.create_task("path/to/your/file.pdf")

# Task is created but processing may not be complete
print(task.task_id)
print(task.status)  # Might be "Starting"
```
</CodeGroup>

You can check on the task's progress later using `poll()`.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# ... do other work ...

# Check status when needed
result = task.poll()
print(result.status)
print(result.output)  # Now contains processed results if status is "Succeeded"
```
</CodeGroup>

### Supported Input Sources

Our SDK automatically detects the input type from various sources:

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
from PIL import Image
import base64

chunkr = Chunkr()

# From a file path
task = chunkr.upload("path/to/your/file.pdf")

# From an opened file
with open("path/to/your/file.pdf", "rb") as f:
    task = chunkr.upload(f)

# From a URL
task = chunkr.upload("https://example.com/document.pdf")

# From a base64 string
with open("path/to/your/document.pdf", "rb") as f:
    base64_string = base64.b64encode(f.read()).decode("utf-8")
task = chunkr.upload(base64_string, file_name="document.pdf")

# From a PIL Image
img = Image.open("path/to/your/photo.jpg")
task = chunkr.upload(img)
```
</CodeGroup>


## Reading Tasks

Retrieve information for any task using its `task_id`. This is useful for checking the status or accessing results of previously created tasks.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from chunkr_ai import Chunkr
chunkr = Chunkr()

# Get task by ID
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123")

# Access task information
print(task.status)
print(task.output)
```
</CodeGroup>

### Customizing the Response

You can tailor the response to include or exclude certain data.

| Parameter        | Default | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `include_chunks` | `True`  | When `True`, includes all processed chunks. Set to `False` for a lighter response with only task metadata. |
| `base64_urls`    | `False` | When `True`, returns asset URLs as base64-encoded strings instead of temporary pre-signed URLs. Ideal for offline use.                 |

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Get task without chunk data
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123", include_chunks=False) 

# Get task with base64-encoded image URLs
task = chunkr.get_task("task_123", base64_urls=True)
```
```bash cURL
# Get task without chunks
curl -X GET "https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/{task_id}?include_chunks=false" -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Get task with base64-encoded URLs
curl -X GET "https://api.chunkr.ai/api/v1/task/{task_id}?base64_urls=true" -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
