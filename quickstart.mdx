This guide provides a streamlined approach to using the Chunkr API for document processing and analysis.
The way you use the API is by creating a task for each document you want to process, and then polling the task until it is completed.

## Setup

1. **Create an Account**

   Go to [chunkr.ai](https://www.chunkr.ai) and create an account. Once logged in, navigate to the API section to obtain your API key.

2. **Create a task**

   Use the following curl command to create a new task:

   ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.chunkmydocs.com/api/v1/task \
        -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
        -H "Authorization: ${YOUR_API_KEY}" \
        -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.pdf" \
        -F "model=Fast" \
        -F "target_chunk_length=512" \
        -F "ocr_strategy=Auto"
   ```

   This command will return the task object containing the `task_id` needed for polling the task.

3. **Get the task**

   Use the following curl command to check the status of your task:

   ```bash
   curl -X GET https://api.chunkmydocs.com/api/v1/task/${TASK_ID} \
     -H "Authorization: ${YOUR_API_KEY}"
   ```

   Keep polling this endpoint until the `status` field in the response changes to `Succeeded`. Once successful, the `output` field in the response will contain the processed data.

4. **Interpreting the Response**

   The API returns a task object with the following key fields:

   - `task_id`: Unique identifier for the task
   - `status`: Current status of the task (Starting, Processing, Succeeded, Failed, or Canceled)
   - `output`: Contains the processed data when the task is successful

   For a full list of fields, and explanation of the output, refer to the [task response](/task-response) page.
