title: Task response
description: "Understanding the task object"
---

The chunkr api works by creating a task for each document you want to process, and then processing them asynchronously.
Both creating and getting tasks return a task object.

## Task Object

Both creating and getting tasks return a task object.
It contains the information about the file you are processing as well as the output when the task is successful.

```typescript
interface TaskResponse {
  configuration: {
    model: Model;
    ocr_strategy: OcrStrategy;
    target_chunk_length: number;
  };
  created_at: string;
  expires_at?: string;
  file_name: string;
  finished_at?: string;
  input_file_url: string;
  message: string;
  output?: OutputResponse;
  page_count: number;
  status: "Starting" | "Processing" | "Succeeded" | "Failed" | "Cancelled";
  task_id: string;
  task_url: string;
}
```

## Output

The output response is a dictionary containing two keys: `chunks` and `extracted_json`. The `chunks` key contains the structured segments data as defined in the [Chunks](/chunks.mdx) section, while the `extracted_json` key contains any structured data extracted from the document as defined in the [Structured Extraction](/structured_extraction.mdx) section. Below is an example of the output response:

### Breakdown of the Extracted JSON

- **extracted_json**: (Optional) Additional JSON data extracted based on the provided JSON schema during task creation.
  - **title**: The title of the extracted data.
  - **schema_type**: The type of JSON schema used.
  - **extracted_fields**: An array of fields extracted, each containing:
    - **name**: The name of the field.
    - **field_type**: The data type of the field (e.g., list, string).
    - **value**: The extracted value corresponding to the field.

For a comprehensive understanding of each component, please refer to the [Structured Extraction](/structured_extraction.mdx) and [Chunks](/chunks.mdx) sections.

```

## Configuration

`Configuration` is the configuration you used to create the task. You can find more information about how to configure the task in the [configuration](/model) section.

## File Name

The file name is the name of the file you are processing.

## Input File Url

The input file url is a presigned url to the file you are processing.

## PDF Url

Apart from PDFs, we accept, DOC(X), PPT(X), and XLS(X) files. We generate a PDF for each of these file types that you can annotate in the `pdf_url` field in the `TaskResponse`.

## Message

The message is a message that is displayed to the user. It is used to provide more information about the task status and potential errors.

## Output

The output is the processed data of the file you are processing. You can find more information about the output in the [output](/chunks) section.

On status `Succeeded`, the output will contain a `chunks` array. Click [here](/chunks) to learn more about the chunk object.

## Page Count

The page count is the number of pages in the file you are processing.

## Status

The task status can be one of the following:

- `Starting`: The task is queued and waiting to be processed
- `Processing`: The task is still processing
- `Succeeded`: The task is successful
- `Failed`: The task failed
- `Cancelled`: The task was cancelled (coming soon)

## Task Url

The task url is the url to poll and get the task object.
