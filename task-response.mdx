description: "Understanding the task object"

The chunkr api works by creating a task for each document you want to process, and then processing them asynchronously.
Both creating and getting tasks return a task object. 

## Task Object

Both creating and getting tasks return a task object. 
It contains the information about the file you are processing as well as the output when the task is successful.

```json
{
  "task_id": "1234567890",
  "status": "Processing",
  "created_at": "2023-04-01T12:00:00Z",
  "finished_at": null,
  "expires_at": "2023-04-08T12:00:00Z",
  "message": "Segementing",
  "input_file_url": "https://presigned_url",
  "output": null,
  "task_url": "https://api.chunkr.ai/task/1234567890",
  "configuration": {
    "model": "Fast",
    "ocr_strategy": "Auto",
    "target_chunk_length": 512
  },
  "file_name": "document.pdf",
  "page_count": 10
}
```

## Status

The task status can be one of the following:

- `Starting`: The task is queued and waiting to be processed
- `Processing`: The task is still processing
- `Succeeded`: The task is successful
- `Failed`: The task failed
- `Cancelled`: The task was cancelled (coming soon)

## Message

The message is a message that is displayed to the user. It is used to provide more information about the task status and potential errors.

## Input File Url

The input file url is a presigned url to the file you are processing.

## Output

The output is the processed data of the file you are processing. You can find more information about the output in the [output](/output) section.

## Configuration

## Task Url
