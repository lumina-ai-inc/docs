description: "Understanding the task object"

The chunkr api works by creating a task for each document you want to process, and then processing them asynchronously.
Both creating and getting tasks return a task object.

## Task Object

Both creating and getting tasks return a task object.
It contains the information about the file you are processing as well as the output when the task is successful.

```typescript
interface TaskResponse {
  configuration: {
    model: Model;
    ocr_strategy: OcrStrategy;
    target_chunk_length: number;
  };
  created_at: string;
  expires_at?: string;
  file_name: string;
  finished_at?: string;
  input_file_url: string;
  message: string;
  output?: Chunk[];
  page_count: number;
  status: "Starting" | "Processing" | "Succeeded" | "Failed" | "Cancelled";
  task_id: string;
  task_url: string;
}
```

## Configuration

`Configuration` is the configuration you used to create the task. You can find more information about how to configure the task in the [configuration](/model) section.

## File Name

The file name is the name of the file you are processing.

## Input File Url

The input file url is a presigned url to the file you are processing.

## PDF Url

Apart from PDFs, we accept, DOC(X), PPT(X), and XLS(X) files. We generate a PDF for each of these file types that you can annotate in the `pdf_url` field in the `TaskResponse`.

## Message

The message is a message that is displayed to the user. It is used to provide more information about the task status and potential errors.

## Output

The output is the processed data of the file you are processing. You can find more information about the output in the [output](/chunks) section.

On status `Succeeded`, the output will contain a `chunks` array. Click [here](/chunks) to learn more about the chunk object.

## Page Count

The page count is the number of pages in the file you are processing.

## Status

The task status can be one of the following:

- `Starting`: The task is queued and waiting to be processed
- `Processing`: The task is still processing
- `Succeeded`: The task is successful
- `Failed`: The task failed
- `Cancelled`: The task was cancelled (coming soon)

## Task Url

The task url is the url to poll and get the task object.
